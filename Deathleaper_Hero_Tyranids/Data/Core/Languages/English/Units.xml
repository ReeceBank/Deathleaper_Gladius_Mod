	<entry name="Tyranids/DeathleaperFlavor" value="The Deathleaper was created as Hive Fleet Leviathan's ultimate assassin, but it is much more than that. The Deathleaper is a terror weapon, one created to utterly undermine the enemy's morale and break their will to oppose the swarm. With strong instincts and a relentless skill it is a monstrous predator that toys with its prey."/>
